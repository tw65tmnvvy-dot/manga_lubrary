# Minimal requirements for running the app
# Tkinter is part of the standard library for most Python installs.
# The embedded SQLite engine is provided by Python's standard library module `sqlite3`.
# Most official Python installers (python.org) include sqlite3. If your Python lacks sqlite3
# you can still use the app with CSV storage (default). To check whether your Python has
# sqlite support, run:
#
#   python3 -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
#
# If that command fails, install an official Python distribution (python.org) for your OS
# or re-install Python with SQLite support enabled. On Windows, download the Windows
# installer from https://python.org/downloads and run it (choose "Install for all users"
# or enable the recommended options). On macOS, use the official installer or install via
# Homebrew (`brew install python`) and ensure sqlite dev headers were present when Python
# was built.

# Optional dependency used for creating standalone executables only:
pyinstaller>=5.0  # optional; only needed if you want to create .exe/.app files
Pillow>=9.0      # optional but recommended for cover image support in the GUI
